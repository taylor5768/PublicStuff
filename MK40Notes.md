We speculated that factives and non-factives by differ how at-issue they are. 
* The alternative relations made salient by focusing a non-factive predicate necessarily non-veridical (b/c they always include the non-factive relation).
* So non-factive predicates always leave open the possibility that their complement is false. Therfore, their complements are always *at-issue*, regardless of whether the complement is information-structurally backgrounded via predicate focus. This accounts for the observation that projection of non-factive CCs were consistently minimally projective regardless of prosody. 
* In contrast, the salient alternatives w/ focus on a factive predicates are not necessarily non-veridical.  So their complements are more easily made *not*-at-issue via information-structural backgrounding via predicate focus. This accounts for the observation that projection of factives is influenced by prosody: more projection w/focus on predicate (complement backgrounded, hence not-at-issue) vs. complement (complement foregrounded, hence at-issue).

The goal of this experiment was to see if this prediction was borne out. We were reminded by this paper (https://github.com/judith-tonhauser/projective-probability/blob/master/papers/factives-paper/submission-April2020/paper.pdf) that factivity and veridicality don't necessarily pattern together: there are veridical non-factive predicates (be right, demonstrate). 


<b>6 predicates:</b>

realize: factive, veridical

discover: factive, veridical

know: factive, veridical

be right: *non-factive*, *veridical*

say: non-factive, non-veridical

believe: non-factive, non-veridical

<b>6 lexical contents:</b> each lexical content paired with 2 predicates (1 factive, 1 non-factive)

Martha (about Andrew and Rhonda):
Did Andrew discover that she visited the zoo?

*Is Martha certain that Rhonda visited the zoo?*

3 prosodic conditions:
* narrow focus on *predicate* (L* on predicate, H-H% on final content word)
* narrow focus on *pronoun subject* (L* on pronoun subject, H-H% on final content word)
* focus over *whole complement* (no exact ToBI- prominence on last content word and predicate)

# Summary
Our initial hypothesis about veridicality predicting at-issueness was incorrect: veridical predicates are NOT more at-issue than non-veridical predicates. So this hypothesis doesn't explain why factive predicates but not non-factive predicates would be sensitive to effects of prosody on projection.

And, veridicality doesn't predict projection either: the complement of be right is the least projective! 

But, it does look like not-at-issueness is a better predictor of projection for some predicates vs. others: it looks to be a very bad predictor for say and believe - and these are the two non-veridical predicates in our dataset. 

So:
- differences in effects of prosody on projection can't be attributed to differences in at-issueness due to predicate veridicality
- but the role that at-issueness plays in predicting projection does seem to differ based on the veridicality of the predicate: at-issueness doesn't really seem to play a role for non-veridical predicates.
